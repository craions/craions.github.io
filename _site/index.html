        Reflect On
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Sep 2022</span>

    <h3><img src="https://images.fiftyfootshadows.net/2022/06/reflect_on_standards.jpg" alt="image-title-here" class="img-responsive" /></h3>

<p>Since posting last here I have managed to travel half way round the world and back and while on the trip I snapped quite a few photos that, looking back on, I like quite a lot and want to share! During this trip I caught myself shooting in portrait more than I ever had before so I leaned into it a bit with the intention of making a new zine/book of the images as a collection but that will take time and money to pull together so no announcements yet. Just chipping away at editing and pooling together my favorites for that.</p>

<p>In the mean time I am looking around photos that I could share as wallpaper images, do people still look for and use wallpapers for their computers even? Ive been in this game a long time and I sort of feel a shift away from that fun dig around online for new images for digital workspaces but I could be wrong, who knows. Im still here and I still think this is a fun way to share photographs so why not right? I may make a pack of wallpapers from this trip but I may start trickling them out here one at a time, we’ll see how it plays out as I make time to start digging into my library.</p>

<p>My biggest problem right now is still the act of trying to find enough confidence to share much of anything online. It feels like the older I get, the more alienated I feel within the online world. A lot of it has to do with its shifting focus and our lack of attention as trends in social media have moved to quick, rapid engagement. The tiny spike of adrenaline we get as images zip past our eyes for a few seconds and, like a slot machine, we pull down for more, and more, and more, until time and thought mean not much of anything. We blink. and look up from our phones with that dazed, cloudy look in our eyes, and try to focus on reality.</p>

<p>Places like this, full of words and a commitment to more than 5 seconds of time feel daunting to many in comparison. So, if you’re here, and you made it this far, hi! How have you been? The photo above was taken on a little island in Korea which is only accessible by car during low tide. The road heading to it is a long skinny one that ends up fully underwater as the ocean rises up. No warning, no gates, just a road that slowly disappears. The island itself seems to be largely dedicated to campsites, small hotels, and a million seafood restaurants which all have greeters out by the road to entice every car that passes to park and come in for lunch. Its kitschy and fun and I kind of wish we had more time to wander around and explore while we were there.</p>

<p>I look forward to sharing more here as time goes on, I still want to release the album mentioned on my previous hope post and I think I have the nerve to do it sooner than later and I also have been sitting on some 50ft Radio mixes for what feels like years now? Where on earth does the time go? See you again soon.</p>

        Photographic Timbre
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2022</span>

    <h3><img src="https://images.fiftyfootshadows.net/2020/12/timbre.jpg" alt="image-title-here" class="img-responsive" /></h3>

<p>I should admit, my prose is a bit rusty these days and this whole piece may seem a little out there, so I will try and keep this one short. Have you ever tried to listen to a photograph?</p>

<p>“They” say a photo is worth a thousand words, a statement that I have always considered to be a little silly, most photos simply sit idly with little more than the light they hold on to so dearly and breathe quietly, yet if you place yourself in a space of mental ambiguity you may be able to make out the song a photograph sings. Even if only faintly.</p>

<p>It could be as clear and obvious as a train passing, the busy sounds of city life, or the gentle swaying distortion of wind blowing through an empty landscape but sometimes if you really let yourself dive into the exercise you may find your imagination pull you in deeper. The rustle of fabric, laughter just out of frame, the key of a color, rhythm of a texture, or shallow bellowing drone of an empty field.</p>

<p>I think what most people may discover are connections to their past. Memory defines our perspective on everything so this practice can be a place to center your thoughts for creative writing or simply a means of escape.</p>

<p>This dawned on me recently while looking around on Flickr. If I stopped for more than a couple of seconds to look at a photo I could, to a certain extent, intuit its soundscape, so I started to try and put into words what it could mean; to consider something silent as having an acoustic space around it. What came to mind as I thought of a way to describe it was “Photographic Timbre”, a term that at least vaguely fits the criteria. It seems silly and maybe a little contrived if you’re a bit cynical about art but it’s a fun exercise all the same.</p>

<p>Maybe look at it as a mindful practice, one of reflection, gratitude, and awareness, and see where it takes you. Our life breathes music in every moment of every day so why not extend our perspective in a creative new way? Surely I’m not the only one looking for new or unique pathways to discover moments of peace in these unpredictable times. Maybe you will find a few extra moments of that solace as well.</p>

    <h3><img src="https://images.fiftyfootshadows.net/2021/11/moonrise_desktops.jpg" alt="image-title-here" class="img-responsive" /></h3>

<p>For someone who has long told himself that he’s not really that much of a fan of the beach I sure do share a lot of photos taken from oceanic shores. Back at the Atlantic, and there in the distance you can see the moon rising as the sun set behind me. These are the moments you live through and know somehow intrinsically that it you won’t soon forget. Surrounding memories sort of clump together around these remarkable scenes and and they collide in our minds, forming a sort of mosaic of a period of time. The air, the sound, the smell, the reason you were at this place and how close to loved ones you may or may not have been. It’s beautiful and if you are somehow missing this kind of weight during times of genuine, life affirming, nuance then its probably time you re-evaluate your choices in life.</p>

<p>How has everyone been? I’m around, as is my lack of personal space and time so posting continues to be slow but that’s OK. The online world around this little web page has become so vast and distorted since the inception of fifty foot shadows that I’m not sure it’s worth my time to wonder if I should still be stopping by these pages to share. The answer has been becoming pretty clear to me lately that now, more than ever, spaces like these are becoming islands in the social online world. Slang and generations are shifting but people are still out there looking for their familiars and connecting in heart felt ways to others just as lost or found as they are.</p>

<p>All of the surface noise brought forth by the lurking masses simply fades away when you cozy into a place where you can feel comfortable and unafraid. So I hope you, dear reader, can still hop over here from time to time and know the internet can be both never ending as well as quite small. The photo here is of course available for you to grab and use as a wallpaper. It’s landscape so it naturally forms better to a desktop but there is a mobile version here as well for phones and tablets. HD file is over on gumroad. (Thanks to those who choose to continue to support!)</p>

<p>I hope to be back with a few more photos from this recent trip sooner than later. Till then, have a good one. Stay safe out there and look after each other. XO</p>

        スライス・オブ・ライフ
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2022</span>

    <p>スライス・オブ・ライフ（Slice of life 人生の一断片、日常の一コマ）は、芸術やエンターテイメント作品において、ありふれた日常を描くことをいう[1]。演劇においては自然主義（英語版）を指すが、文学用語としては物語（ナラティブ）の一手法であり、登場人物の人生や生活における出来事が恣意的にも思える順序で提示され、プロットの発展や対立（葛藤）、説明を欠いたまま、オープン・エンディングで作品が終えられることもある。
この言葉はテレビCMなど広告の表現スタイルの分析に使われることもある。例えば、谷川俊太郎の詩『朝のリレー』をモチーフにしたネスカフェのCMは「スライス・オブ・ライフ」を描いているといわれる[n 1]。</p>

<h3 id="映画と舞台">映画と舞台</h3>

<p>演劇用語における「スライス・オブ・ライフ」は、現実と理想の狭間にある実生活（英語版）を自然主義的に描くことであり、「スライス・オブ・ライフなダイアローグのある芝居」のように場合によっては形容詞として用いられる。英語のSlice of lifeはもともとフランスの劇作家ジャン・ジュリアン (1854–1919)が1890年から1895年にかけてフランス語の「tranche de vie」から借用して使い始めたのがその起源である[3]。
ジャン・ジュリアンは自分の作品『セレナード』を舞台にかけてからほどなく、この言葉を自身の理論において用いるようになった。ウェイン・S・ターニーのエッセイ『芝居における自然主義へのノート』(“Notes on Naturalism in the Theatre”)では当時の状況がこう紹介されている。</p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2020</span>

    <p>Lanyon is an unassuming <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It’s based on <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>, the Jekyll butler.</p>

<h3 id="built-on-poole">Built on Poole</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="/404">404</a>, <a href="/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>, posts, and <a href="/about">example page</a>)</li>
  <li>Mobile friendly design and development</li>
  <li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
  <li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
  <li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lanyon-features">Lanyon features</h3>

<p>In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes">Eight optional color schemes</a>, available via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code> classes</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme">Head to the readme</a> to learn more.</p>

<h3 id="browser-support">Browser support</h3>

<p>Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>
